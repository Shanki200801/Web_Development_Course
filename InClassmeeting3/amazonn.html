    <p>  Jeff Bezos founded Amazon from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[11] on July 5, 1994. It started as an online marketplace for books but
         expanded to sell electronics, software, video games, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as 
         the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization.[12] In August 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for US$13.4 billion,
         which substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[13] In 2018, its two-day delivery service, Amazon Prime, 
         surpassed 100 million subscribers worldwide.[14]
