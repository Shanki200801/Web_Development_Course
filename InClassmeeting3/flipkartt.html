        groceries, and lifestyle products.

        As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.
        Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, 
        and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.
