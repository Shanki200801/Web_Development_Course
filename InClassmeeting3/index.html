            An online marketplace (or online e-commerce marketplace) is a type of e-commerce website where product or service information is provided by multiple third<br>
            parties. Online marketplaces are the primary type of multichannel ecommerce and can be a way to streamline the production process.<br>
            In an online marketplace, consumer transactions are processed by the marketplace operator and then delivered and fulfilled<br>
            by the participating retailers or wholesalers. These type of websites allow users to register and sell single items to many items for a "post-selling" fee.<br>
            In general, because marketplaces aggregate products from a wide array of providers, selection is usually more wide, and availability is higher than in vendor-specific<br>
            online retail stores.[1] Since 2014 online marketplaces have become abundant.[2] Some online marketplaces have a wide variety of general interest products that cater<br>
            to almost all the needs of the consumers, others are consumer specific and cater to a particular segment<br>
